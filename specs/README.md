# Implementation Specification — RWA Tokenization Platform on Bitcoin

## Overview

This specification defines the implementation plan for a **Real World Asset (RWA) Trading Platform with Social Impact**, built on Bitcoin and Liquid. The platform enables users to tokenize real-world assets, trade fractional tokens over Liquid, and fund educational initiatives through automated treasury mechanics.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Wallet**: Self-custodial Bitcoin wallet with Lightning Network integration (inspired by Blink/Galoy).
- **Tokenization Engine**: AI-assisted asset evaluation and on-chain token issuance for real-world assets.
- **Marketplace**: Peer-to-peer trading of fractional asset tokens secured by Multisig 2-of-3 escrow.
- **Social Impact**: Platform fees automatically fund an educational treasury.

### Design Principles

1. **Don't Trust, Verify** — All transactions are on-chain verifiable. Multisig escrow ensures trustless exchange.
2. **Modularity** — Each domain (wallet, tokenization, marketplace, education) is an independent service behind a unified API gateway.
3. **Security First** — All secret material (keys, seeds) is encrypted at rest. No plaintext secrets in logs or responses.
4. **Scalability** — Stateless API servers behind a load balancer; horizontally scalable with containerized deployment.
5. **Transparency** — Platform fees, treasury balances, and fund allocations are publicly auditable.
